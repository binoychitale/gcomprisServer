# gcomprisServer
This project is essentially a suite of scripts to install and configure the GCompris Educational Program on Linux to run using database and configuration files served from a local Samba server.

The setup will be in two parts :
1) Server Setup
2) CLient Setup

# 1) Server Setup
  In order to set up a samba server, download the serversetup.sh file and run this command in the download directory(If you are downloading the file from a browser, it will likely be in the /home/<user>/Downloads folder.) :-
###  sh serversetup.sh

# 2) Client setup
  In order to setup the client machine, download the serversetup.sh file and run this command in the download directory(If you are downloading the file from a browser, it will likely be in the /home/<user>/Downloads folder.) :-
###  sh clientsetup.sh
